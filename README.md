# Med Man Sports - FFmpeg Audio Processing API

A Rust web service that provides FFmpeg functionality through HTTP endpoints. This project demonstrates various Rust concepts through practical implementation of audio file processing.

## Features
- Get media file information
- Split audio files into chunks
- RESTful API using Axum

## Rust Concepts Demonstrated

### Basic Concepts
- **Modules**: Using `mod` to organize code (`mod ffmpeg`)
- **Structs**: Custom types like `FFmpegClient` and `MediaInfo`
- **Enums**: Used in error handling
- **Implementations**: Using `impl` blocks for struct methods
- **String vs &str**: String ownership in FFmpeg paths and commands

### Ownership & Borrowing
- **References**: Using `&self` and `&mut self` in methods
- **Lifetimes**: Managing string lifetimes in command arguments
- **Ownership**: Moving and borrowing PathBuf and String values
- **Temporary Values**: Handling lifetimes of temporary strings and paths

### Traits
- **Into<T>**: Generic constraints for flexible path inputs
- **AsRef<Path>**: Path reference conversions
- **Debug**: Derived debug printing for structs

### Error Handling
- **Result Type**: Returning `Result<T, E>` from FFmpeg operations
- **Option Type**: Handling optional fields like `input_file`
- **Unwrap/Expect**: Handling potential None values

### Modern Rust Patterns
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent interface for FFmpeg client configuration
- **Method Chaining**: `with_input()`, `with_output_dir()`, etc.
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for FFmpeg operations

### Async Programming
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous HTTP endpoints
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for web server
- **Future**: Async function returns

### File System Operations
- **PathBuf**: Path manipulation for files
- **std::fs**: Directory creation and file listing
- **File Extensions**: Filtering files by extension

### Command Execution
- **std::process::Command**: Running FFmpeg commands
- **Command Builder**: Constructing complex FFmpeg commands
- **Output Parsing**: Processing FFmpeg stderr output

### Web Framework (Axum)
- **Routing**: HTTP endpoint definition
- **JSON Responses**: Using serde_json for API responses
- **HTTP Server**: TCP listener setup

## Project Structure

### Routes
- `GET /hello` - Basic health check endpoint
- `GET /media/info` - Get media file information
- `GET /split` - Split audio into chunks

### Implementation Details

#### FFmpeg Integration
Currently uses CLI-based FFmpeg execution:
- Uses `std::process::Command` to run FFmpeg commands
- Parses FFmpeg output from stderr
- No direct FFmpeg library bindings

#### FFmpegClient Structure

```rust
pub struct FFmpegClient {
binary_path: String, // Path to FFmpeg executable
input_file: Option<PathBuf>, // Input file to process
output_dir: Option<PathBuf>, // Output directory for chunks
chunk_duration: Option<Duration>, // Duration for splitting
}
```

#### Split Operation
- Creates chunks of specified duration
- Uses FFmpeg segment feature
- Output format: `chunk_000.mp3`, `chunk_001.mp3`, etc.
- Maintains original audio codec and quality

### Future Improvements
1. Switch to FFmpeg library bindings for better performance
2. Add more audio processing features
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add configuration options
5. Add progress tracking for long operations

### Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### Requirements
- FFmpeg installed and available in PATH
- Rust 1.75 or later
- Available port 3000

### Next Steps: Speech-to-Text Integration

#### Planned Features
1. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - Process audio chunks in parallel
   - Output timestamped transcriptions
   - Support multiple languages

#### Potential Implementations

1. **Whisper Integration** (Recommended)
```rust
// Using whisper-rs crate
use whisper_rs::{WhisperContext, WhisperContextParameters};

pub struct TranscriptionResult {
    text: String,
    timestamp: f32,
    confidence: f32,
}
```

2. **Cloud Services Option**
   - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
   - AWS Transcribe
   - Azure Speech Services

3. **Local Processing**
   - Vosk (offline speech recognition)
   - Mozilla DeepSpeech

#### New Endpoints to Add
```
POST /transcribe
- Input: Audio file
- Output: JSON with transcription chunks

GET /transcribe/{id}/status
- Check transcription progress

GET /transcribe/{id}/result
- Get final transcription with timestamps
```

#### Data Structure
```json
{
    "chunks": [
        {
            "start_time": "00:00:00",
            "end_time": "00:00:02",
            "text": "transcribed text here",
            "confidence": 0.95
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "language": "en",
        "model": "whisper-large",
        "total_duration": "00:03:24"
    }
}
```

#### Technical Considerations
1. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Audio splitting (current functionality)
   - Parallel transcription of chunks
   - Result aggregation and timestamp alignment

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Chunk caching
   - Background processing
   - Progress tracking

3. **Error Handling**
   - Audio quality issues
   - Language detection
   - Failed transcriptions

4. **Storage**
   - Temporary chunk storage
   - Transcription results
   - Processing status

#### Transcriber Abstraction Design
1. **Trait-Based Design**
```rust
// Core trait for different transcription implementations
trait Transcriber {
    fn transcribe(&self, audio: AudioChunk) -> Result<TranscriptionResult, TranscriberError>;
}
```

2. **Potential Implementations**
   - `WhisperTranscriber`: Local processing using Whisper
   - `GoogleTranscriber`: Cloud-based using Google API
   - `VoskTranscriber`: Offline processing using Vosk
   - `MockTranscriber`: For testing purposes

3. **Integration with Current System**
   - Extend FFmpegClient to work with Transcriber implementations
   - Process chunks in parallel using tokio
   - Aggregate results maintaining timestamp order

4. **Benefits**
   - Swap transcription backends without changing core logic
   - Easy to test with mock implementation
   - Consistent interface for all transcription methods
   - Simple to add new transcription services

5. **Considerations**
   - Error handling across different implementations
   - Consistent result format
   - Performance characteristics
   - Resource management (memory, API quotas)
   - Async processing coordination
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Rust (1.75 or later)
   - FFmpeg

2. **Install FFmpeg**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

   # Windows (with Chocolatey)
   choco install ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Verify FFmpeg Installation**
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

4. **Project Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create required directories
   mkdir -p src/chunks

   # Build and run
   cargo run
   ```

5. **Test File**
   - Place an `audio.mp3` file in the `src` directory for testing
   - Or update the path in `main.rs` to point to your audio file

### Troubleshooting

1. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Ensure FFmpeg is in your system PATH
   - Try running `ffmpeg` in terminal
   - Restart your terminal after installation

2. **Common Issues**
   - Missing `src/chunks` directory
   - Missing test audio file
   - Port 3000 already in use (change in `main.rs`)

3. **Verification**
   ```bash
   # Test the API
   curl http://localhost:3000/hello
   curl http://localhost:3000/media/info
   ```
# medman-sports-video-processor


1. Splitting Strategies

Current: Fixed 2-second chunks
Potential approaches:
- Split by silence detection
- Split by custom duration
- Split by markers/timestamps
- Split by beat detection (for music)

2. Chunk Operations

Basic Operations:
- Reorder chunks (move chunk X to position Y)
- Delete chunks
- Duplicate chunks
- Insert silence between chunks

Advanced Operations:
- Crossfade between chunks
- Adjust individual chunk volume
- Trim start/end of chunks
- Join adjacent chunks

3. Project Management

Need to track:
- Original audio file
- Chunk metadata
  • Original position
  • Current position
  • Duration
  • Start/end times
- Sequence history (for undo/redo)
- Project settings


⌘K to generate a command
can you give me the 3 curl request i can make @main.rs 

Here are the 3 curl requests you can make based on your main.rs routes:
Hello endpoint:
hello
Expected response:
}
Media Info endpoint:
info
Expected response:
}
Split Video endpoint:
split
Expected response:
}
Note: Make sure:
Your server is running (cargo run)
You have an audio.mp3 file in your src directory
You have a chunks directory in your src directory for the split functionality
getting these error: 


This error occurs because the src/chunks directory doesn't exist when trying to split the audio file. The error No such file or directory indicates that FFmpeg can't write to the output directory because it hasn't been created.
Let's modify the split_video function to create the chunks directory if it doesn't exist:
Before running the curl commands, make sure:
You have an audio.mp3 file in your src directory
The program has write permissions in the src directory
You can verify these by:
Checking if the audio file exists:
mp3
Creating the chunks directory manually (alternative approach):
chunks
After making these changes, try the split request again:
split
I have: 
/Users/mehdisalemi/Desktop/med-man-sports-video-processor/src/audio.mp3

The issue might be related to the working directory when running the server. The paths in your code are relative (src/audio.mp3 and src/chunks), but the server might be running from a different working directory.
Let's modify the code to use absolute paths:
3 hidden lines
This modification:
Gets the absolute path of the current working directory
Constructs absolute paths for both the audio file and chunks directory
Uses these absolute paths in the FFmpeg commands
Also, let's verify a few things:
Make sure the audio file exists:
mp3
Check if FFmpeg is installed and accessible:
version
Make sure you have write permissions in the src directory:
/
Try running the server again after these changes and let me know if you still get the error.
i dont think i have ffmeg installed

Ah, that's the root cause! You need to install FFmpeg on your system. Since you're on macOS (I can tell from the zsh shell), you can install FFmpeg using Homebrew.
First, if you don't have Homebrew installed, install it:
"
Then install FFmpeg:
ffmpeg
Verify the installation:
version
After installing FFmpeg, your Rust application should work correctly. Try running your server again and making the API requests:
run
Then in another terminal:
info
or
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/split
Let me know if you need any help with the installation process!
@main.rs @ffmpeg.rs 
I have this code so far that can split audio into 2 econd chunks, can you help me understand it

I'll break down the main components and functionality of your code:
Main Components:
chunks
FFmpeg Client Structure:
}
The code uses a builder pattern where you chain methods to configure the FFmpeg command:
)
Key Functions:
media_info() endpoint:
Gets the current directory
Constructs path to audio.mp3 in src folder
Uses FFmpeg to extract information about:
Duration
Bitrate
Format
Sample rate
Channels
split_video() endpoint:
Creates a chunks directory if it doesn't exist
Uses FFmpeg to split the audio file into 2-second segments
Returns paths to all created chunks
FFmpeg Command Explanation:
The actual FFmpeg command being run is:
mp3
Where:
-f segment: Use segmenting format
-segment_time 2: Each segment is 2 seconds
-c copy: Copy codec (no re-encoding)
-reset_timestamps 1: Reset timestamps for each segment
chunk_%03d.mp3: Output format (chunk_001.mp3, chunk_002.mp3, etc.)
Usage Example:
split
The split operation will:
Create a 'chunks' directory in src/
Split audio.mp3 into 2-second segments
Return JSON with paths to all chunks
Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
OKay, do not implement anything, lets brainstorm. 

I want to create a audio player of sorts than can move chunks into different positions

Let's brainstorm how to build an audio chunk reordering system. Here are some key concepts and features we could consider:
Chunk Management:
Store metadata about each chunk:
}
Playlist/Sequence Management:
Data structure to represent the sequence:
}
Operations We Might Want:
Move chunk from position X to Y
Delete a chunk
Insert silence between chunks
Preview the sequence
Export final audio
Save/load sequence configurations
Undo/redo operations
Get waveform visualization of chunks
API Endpoints We Could Add:
preview
Technical Considerations:
How to handle transitions between chunks
Whether to store reordered audio or reorder on-demand
Memory management for large audio files
Format consistency between chunks
Real-time preview capabilities
Concurrent access to sequences
Would you like to explore any of these areas in more detail? We can discuss the technical implementation of any specific feature.
okay, now how do I bring chunks together? should we create something in our client that can like merge two chunks

Yes! Let's brainstorm how to add chunk merging functionality to the FFmpegClient. We'll need to be able to concatenate audio chunks in a specified order.
FFmpeg has a specific way to concatenate media files using a "concat demuxer". Here's how we could design this:
New Function in FFmpegClient:
New Endpoint to Test Merging:
50 hidden lines
This design:
Creates a temporary file listing all chunks to merge
Uses FFmpeg's concat demuxer to merge chunks without re-encoding
Returns the path to the merged file
You could test it with:
merge
Some considerations for future enhancement:
Allow specifying chunk order in the request
Add error handling for missing chunks
Clean up temporary files
Add progress monitoring for large merges
5. Support different output formats
Handle chunk transitions/crossfading
Validate audio format compatibility
Would you like to implement this and explore any of these enhancements?
how to test this with a curl reuqest?

You can test this with a sequence of curl requests. Here's the step-by-step process:
First, make sure you have an audio file at src/audio.mp3
Split the audio into chunks:
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/split
This will create chunks in src/chunks/ directory like:
chunk_000.mp3
chunk_001.mp3
chunk_002.mp3
etc.
Then merge the chunks:
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/merge
This will create a merged.mp3 file in your src/ directory.
You can verify the process worked by:
Checking that chunks exist:
/
Checking that merged file exists:
mp3
Compare the original and merged files:
info
This will show you the duration and other details of your original file. You can play both files to verify they sound the same.
Note: Currently, the merge endpoint will combine chunks in alphabetical order. If you want to specify a different order, we'd need to modify the endpoint to accept an ordered list of chunk names in the request.
